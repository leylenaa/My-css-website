        <h2>Development of the heart</h2>
        <p>
          The heart develops from embryonic mesodermal germ layer cells that
          differentiate after gastrulation into mesothelium, endothelium, and
          myocardium1. The heart is the first functional organ that develops in
          humans and all other vertebrate embryos, and first begins to beat by
          week 4 of development2. The heart forms initially in the embryonic
          disc as a simple paired tube inside the forming pericardial cavity,
          which when the disc folds, gets carried into the correct anatomical
          position in the chest cavity3. The heart forms from an embryonic
          tissue called mesoderm around 18 to 19 days after fertilization

        <h2>Development of the heart</h2>
        <p>
          The human heart is the first functional organ to develop. It begins
          beating and pumping blood around day 21 or 22, a mere three weeks
          after fertilization. This emphasizes the critical nature of the heart
          in distributing blood through the vessels and the vital exchange of
          nutrients, oxygen, and wastes both to and from the developing baby.
          The critical early development of the heart is reflected by the
          prominent heart bulge that appears on the anterior surface of the
          embryo. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          The heart forms from an embryonic tissue called mesoderm around 18 to
          19 days after fertilization. Mesoderm is one of the three primary germ
          layers that differentiates early in development that collectively
          gives rise to all subsequent tissues and organs. The heart begins to
          develop near the head of the embryo in a region known as the
          cardiogenic area. Following chemical signals called factors from the
          underlying endoderm (another of the three primary germ layers), the
          cardiogenic area begins to form two strands called the cardiogenic
          cords. As the cardiogenic cords develop, a lumen rapidly develops
          within them. At this point, they are referred to as endocardial tubes
          (Figure 19.5.1). The two tubes migrate together and fuse to form a
          single primitive heart tube. The primitive heart tube quickly forms
          five distinct regions. From head to tail, these include the truncus
          arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and
          the sinus venosus. Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus
          venosus, and contractions propel the blood from tail to head, or from
          the sinus venosus to the truncus arteriosus. This is a very different
          pattern from that of an adult. <br><br> <br>The five regions of the primitive heart
          tube develop into recognizable structures in a fully developed heart.
          The truncus arteriosus will eventually divide and give rise to the
          ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk. The bulbus cordis develops into
          the right ventricle. The primitive ventricle forms the left ventricle.
          The primitive atrium becomes the anterior portions of both the right
          and left atria, and the two auricles. The sinus venosus develops into
          the posterior portion of the right atrium, the SA node, and the
          coronary sinus. <br><br> <br>As the primitive heart tube elongates, it begins to
          fold within the pericardium, eventually forming an S shape, which
          places the chambers and major vessels into an alignment similar to the
          adult heart. This process occurs between days 23 and 28. The remainder
          of the heart development pattern includes development of septa and
          valves, and remodeling of the actual chambers. Partitioning of the
          atria and ventricles by the interatrial septum, interventricular
          septum, and atrioventricular septum is complete by the end of the
          fifth week, although the fetal blood shunts remain until birth or
          shortly after. The atrioventricular valves form between weeks five and
          eight, and the semilunar valves form between weeks five and nine.
