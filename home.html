        <h2>Heart</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>
          The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood around the body by
          circulating it <br />through the circulatory/vascular system. It is
          found in the middle mediastinum,<br> wrapped in a two-layered serous sac
          called the pericardium. The heart is shaped <br>as a quadrangular pyramid,
          and orientated as if the pyramid has fallen onto one of <br> its sides so
          that its base faces the posterior thoracic wall, and its apex is
          pointed <br> toward the anterior thoracic wall. The great vessels that
          originate from the heart, <br> radiate their branches to the head and neck,
          the thorax and abdomen and the upper <br>and lower limbs. The heart holds
          a special position in anatomical sciences. For instance,<br> you can live
          without your spleen or with only one kidney, you can even regrow your
          liver <br>but you cannot live without a heart. This page will introduce
          you to the anatomy of the heart.

        <h2>Heart Anatomy</h2>
        <p>The heart has five surfaces: base (posterior), diaphragmatic (inferior), sternocostal (anterior), and left and right pulmonary surfaces. It also has several margins: right, left, superior, and inferior: 
            <ul>
            <li>The right margin is the small section of the right atrium that extends between the superior and inferior vena cava. </li>
            <li>The left margin is formed by the left ventricle and left auricle. </li>
           <li>The superior margin in the anterior view is formed by both atria and their auricles.</li>
            <li>The Inferior margin is marked by the right ventricle.</li>
        </ul>
            Inside, the heart is divided into four heart chambers: two atria (right and left) and two ventricles (right and left). The right atrium and ventricle receive deoxygenated blood from systemic veins and pump it to the lungs, while the left atrium and ventricle receive oxygenated blood from the lungs and pump it to the systemic vessels which distribute it throughout the body. </p>
            <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.5bd0253be0b854452b600821abea9b7a?rik=vWHASyCh4CScBg&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" alt="">
            <h2>Heart valves</h2>
            <p>Heart valves separate atria from ventricles, and ventricles from great vessels. The valves incorporate two or three leaflets (cusps) around the atrioventricular orifices and the roots of great vessels.The cusps are pushed open to allow blood flow in one direction, and then closed to seal the orifices and prevent the backflow of blood. Backward prolapse of the cusps is prevented by the chordae tendineae–also known as the heart strings–fibrous cords that connect the papillary muscles of the ventricular wall to the atrioventricular valves. 
                <br>

                There are two sets of valves: atrioventricular and semilunar. The atrioventricular valves prevent backflow from the ventricles to the atria: <br>
                <ul>
                <li>The right atrioventricular/tricuspid valve is between the right atrium and right ventricle. It has three cusps/leaflets: anterior/anterosuperior, septal, and posterior/inferior.</li>
                <li>The left atrioventricular/bicuspid valve is also called the mitral valve since it only has two cusps and resembles a miter in shape. It is between the left atrium and left ventricle and has two cusps/leaflets: anterior/aortic and posterior/mural.
                It is very easy to remember which is which if you use a mnemonic! Just memorise LAB RAT and you're set!</li>
               </ul>
                Left Atrium: Bicuspid <br>
                Right Atrium: Tricuspid <br> <br> <br>
                Semilunar valves prevent backflow from the great vessels to the ventricles. <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The pulmonary semilunar valve is between the right ventricle and the opening of the pulmonary trunk. It has three semilunar cusps/leaflets: anterior/non-adjacent, left/left adjacent, and right/right adjacent. </li>
                <li>The aortic semilunar valve is between the left ventricle and the opening of the aorta. It has three semilunar cusps/leaflets: left/left coronary, right/right coronary, and posterior/non-coronary. </li></ul>
                In clinical practice, the heart valves can be auscultated, usually by using a stethoscope. In order to be successful, one needs to master the surface projections of the heart. <br>

            <h2>Heart valves mnemonic</h2>
            <p>Need an easy way to remember the four heart valves? Memorise the phrase 'Try Pulling My Aorta', which stands for: <br> <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Tricuspid</li>
                <li>Pulmonary</li>
                <li>Mitral</li>
                <li>Aortic</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>

        <h2>Coronary circulation</h2>
        <p>The heart must also be supplied with oxygenated blood. This is done by the two coronary arteries: left and right. <br>Heart muscles work constantly (thank goodness!), so the heart has a very high nutrient need. The coronary arteries arise from the aortic sinuses at the beginning of the ascending aorta, and then circle the heart–giving off several branches. In this way, oxygenated blood reaches every part of the heart.Venous blood from the heart is collected into the cardiac veins: middle, posterior, and small. They are all tributaries to coronary sinus–a large vessel that delivers deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium.We’ve got you covered with coronary vasculature anatomy here.</p> <br>

        <h2>Great vessels of the heart</h2>
        <p>The great vessels of the heart are the: aorta, pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, and superior and inferior vena cava. Why are they called the great vessels? Because they are large in size; the diameter of the ascending aorta is 2.1 centimeters, which is like the size of an American nickel (five-cent coin), and they all carry blood to and from the heart. Oh, not to mention that the aorta gives off branches which supply the entire body with oxygenated blood.

            Major branches of the aorta include the brachiocephalic trunk, the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery. The superior vena cava receives blood from the upper half of the body via the left and right brachiocephalic veins, and the inferior vena cava from the lower half, through the common iliac veins.</p>
